    <h1> KFS </h1>
    <p> You enter the restaurant and see it's packed but there is one free seat. To your relief you see that there are unoccupied toilets. You also see a door to a room called 'Snail storage', 'That's weird you think to your self.'. What do you do?</p>
    <p> <a href= "./food.html"> Order food.</a> It is a restaurant after all.</p>
    <p> <a href= "./toilets.html"> Finally go pee. </a></p>
    <p> <a href= "./snailstorage/snailstorage.html"> Enter the strangely named room. </a></p>
