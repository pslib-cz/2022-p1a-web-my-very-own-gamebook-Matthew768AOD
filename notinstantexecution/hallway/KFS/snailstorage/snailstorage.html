    <h1> Snail Storage </h1>
    <p> You enter the room and see many containers with snails in them. Seems like the room was correctly name after all. But in the middle of the room you see Bob. He starts talking: 'Hey so uhh you're in a dream right now and uhh you need to eat me to get out. So uhh please do that. Thanks'. You hesitate a bit but you realize that thise whole experience was quite weird. Do you eat Bob?</p>
