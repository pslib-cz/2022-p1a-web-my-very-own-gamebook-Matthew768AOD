    <h1> Food </h1>
    <p> You order a burger and wait for it to arrive. What arrives at your table isn't a burger though. It's a snail, and not just any snail. It's Bob, and he's dead. You look at the waiter, he gives you a knife and fork. But you do not eat Bob, instead you stab yourself with the knife because you cannot handle the truth that Bob is dead.</p>
