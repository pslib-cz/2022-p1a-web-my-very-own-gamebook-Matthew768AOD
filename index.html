    <h1> The Quest For Bob </h1>
    <p> You are sitting in your room when you suddenly get a very bad migrane and pass out. When you wake up you find yourself in a dark room. Also to your horror you find your pet snail Bob is missing. Thankfully you also find two doors, one labeled with 'Instant Execution' and the other one with 'Not Instant Execution'. Which one do you choose to go into?</p>
